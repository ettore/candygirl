This is a collection of helper classes and functions for iOS development.

The guiding principles so far are: short inheritance hierarchy, loose coupling,
use of categories whenever possible, clear and terse names. Generally speaking,
I want to be able to use these classes easily in any iOS project, just plug
them in and go.

Compile with ARC.
